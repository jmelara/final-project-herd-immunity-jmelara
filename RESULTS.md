Overall, I found that counties with higher levels of "herd immunity," meaning close to 60-70% or more of the population either vaccinated or infected, had lower 
levels of current infection rate. There were some exceptions which I attribute to errors in reporting, the rise in COVID variants, or overall vaccine hesitancy. 
The files New York infection and New York compare the levels of current infection in New York State with the overall herd immunity per county, respectively. There is 
also another set of files that provide examples for the state of Arizona. Overall -  darker colors on the maps mean extreme outcomes. 
In the immunity maps - dark green means higher levels of immunity and dark red means lower levels 
In the infection maps - dark green means lower levels of infection and dark red means higher levels
